"""Job scout — find remote contract work, and apply as yourself.

The loop: keep a PROFILE of what you actually are and want; SCAN sources for
remote contracting roles; SCORE each honestly (including the reasons against);
DRAFT tailored application material; you REVIEW and send; TRACK what happened
and when to follow up.

Three design decisions worth stating, because they're what make this useful
rather than dangerous:

  GROUNDED, NOT INVENTED. The drafter may only use facts from your profile.
  Every draft then goes through a fabrication check that scans for specifics
  it can't source — technologies, employers, year-counts, certifications —
  and flags them. An application that quietly claims five years of something
  you've touched twice is worse than no application: it gets found out in
  the interview, and it is your name on it.

  YOU SEND, NOT THE AGENT. Everything up to the send is automated. The send
  is yours. Not a rule for its own sake — an autonomous sender that gets one
  fact wrong has misrepresented you to a real employer under your name, and
  there is no unsend. The cost of a wrong send is asymmetric, so the human
  goes exactly there. Same pattern as self-improve and trend adoption.

  HONEST SCORING. A scout that says every role is a great fit is a scout you
  stop reading. Fit scores carry their reasons AGAINST, and roles you don't
  qualify for are marked as such rather than quietly padded.

#  Everything else here was already automatic: scoring, drafting, the
#  fabrication check, the gates, the send. What wasn't is SUPPLY. Roles had to
#  be handed to it, so "apply to many without intervention" was impossible for
#  a reason that had nothing to do with the applying.
#
#  These are boards that publish their listings openly for exactly this
#  purpose. Nothing is scraped from behind a login, and nothing here touches
#  LinkedIn: automating Easy Apply breaks their terms and gets accounts
#  restricted, which is a bad trade for a contractor whose profile is a
#  business asset.
# =========================================================================== #
# No default boards. Which sites are worth watching is a personal decision —
# the ones that suit a Johannesburg contractor are not the ones that suit a
# graduate in Berlin, and shipping three defaults quietly framed the feature
# as "these three, plus whatever you add". You add what you use.

#  make a claim I couldn't source" tells you nothing about WHICH claims, and

#
#  So: gather every flagged claim across every held draft, and let each one be
#  either confirmed into the profile (it's true, record it) or rejected (it
#  isn't, redraft without it). Confirming is not loosening the guard — it is
#  giving the guard the evidence it was asking for.

#  Deleting them would lose the record — you want to know you saw a role, and
#  what became of it, when the same company advertises again. So they move
#  rather than vanish, and can come back.
#
#  And the pipeline assumed it did the applying. Most applications are still
#  made by a person: a portal form, an email you wrote yourself, a referral.
#  Without a way to say so, a role you'd already applied to sat looking
#  untouched, and follow-ups never started.
